# Ethernet-Switch
Ethernet operates in the data link layer and physical layer. Ethernet switches are
layer 2 devices that link other Ethernet devices together by sending Ethernet
frames between the devices connected to them. Ethernet switches move the
Ethernet frames between the switch ports using the learning and forwarding
process.a
The switch keeps the MAC Address table in the memory.
